As a student of UQAC (University of Chicoutimi in Quebec), I participated in the 5th edition of Ubisoft Montreal’s Game Lab competition. With 3 other programmers from UQAC and 3 artists from UQAT, we made a prototype of an online cooperative game in 10 weeks on Unity3D.

Two players control one submarine: each player controls various modules such as torpedoes and a repair kit. Other controls are asymmetric: one of them controls the vertical movement and can light the environment with a spot light, while the other can control the horizontal movements and fire flares. They must reach the end of the level as quickly as possible while trying to collect treasure chests.

We were nominated for Best Quality of the “3C”, Best Creativity and Integration of the Theme and the Jury’s Special Award. We didn’t won anything though, just like Leo (that was before he got his Oscar).
