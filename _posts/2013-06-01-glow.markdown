*Glow* is a multiplayer first-person shooter made as a graduation project for the Bachelor of Game Design program at ICAN. Players fight each other in a pitch-dark environment and their characters emit light while moving. However, they must move in order to charge up the energy which is needed to shoot.

We participated in the third edition of *[Hits Playtime](http://www.lemonde.fr/hits-playtime/)*, a video game contest for students organized by French newspaper *Le Monde*. Unfortunately, we didn’t won anything but the game had an honorable mention, so we got that going for us which is nice…

You can download the game [here](downloads/GLOW.zip).

The game is currently only playable on a local network, but you can play it online through [Hamachi](https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/).
