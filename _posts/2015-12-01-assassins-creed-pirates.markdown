*[Assassin's Creed Pirates](http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/en-US/games/assassins-creed-pirates.aspx)* is a mobile installment of Ubisoft's popular franchise and is based on the pirate-themed title: *[Black Flag](http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/fr-fr/games/assassins-creed-black-flag.aspx)*.

Right after joining the Parisian mobile-focused studio for an internship, I have been assigned to the game's post launch support to work on feature updates and to fix bugs. As a gameplay programmer, I worked within the Lua-based framework of the studio's proprietary engine.

During this internship, I have also worked on an unannounced online multiplayer project.
