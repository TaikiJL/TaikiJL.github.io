*[City of Love](https://www.facebook.com/CityofLoveParis/)* is an episodic adventure game for mobile platforms. Players can experience a romantic drama set in Paris where their choices will influence the story and their relationships with other characters.

As part of the core team since the early stage of the development, I participated in this project as a gameplay programmer. However, one of my main tasks was to develop a tool in Unity3D for our writers to quickly create branching stories in our production pipeline.

I have also worked on the integration of the animation middleware [Live2D](http://www.live2d.com/en/) into Unity in collaboration with the Japanese company.

The game was released in early 2017 and was supported with content and feature updates until December 2017 (on which I kept working on).

*City of Love: Paris* is available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/city-of-love-paris/id1146752671?mt=8) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubisoft.colparis&hl=en).
